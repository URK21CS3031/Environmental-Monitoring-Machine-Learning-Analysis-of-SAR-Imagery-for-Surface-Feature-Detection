Got it! I'll rewrite your text according to your project 

**Overview**  
This project advances environmental monitoring by combining:  

- Machine Learning for intelligent analysis,  
- SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery for all-weather, high-resolution data, and  
- Advanced Change Detection techniques.  

It aims to enhance surface feature detection and change analysis across areas like climate monitoring, urban development, and disaster management.  

**Features**  
🛰️ SAR imagery-based surface analysis  
🧠 Machine Learning-driven feature extraction  
🔄 Automated change detection pipeline  
📈 Accuracy evaluation using metrics like IoU and F1-score  
🌍 Scalable and modular system for multiple domains  

**Tech Stack**  
- Python  
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch  
- OpenCV, Rasterio, GDAL (for geospatial data processing)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
